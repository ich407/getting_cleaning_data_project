<b>Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project - Tidy Data</b>

The purpose of this project is to merge a series of related data from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" and create a tidy output that can be used for future analysis.

Relevant files: 

run_analysis.R - the code used to merge and generate the tidy data set as requested for the assignment:
<li>1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li>5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>

tidy_average.txt - the output data set as requsted in step 5 "creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject"

CodeBook.md - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
